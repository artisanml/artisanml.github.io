### What is Smartfin?

Smartfin is a **stock analysis platform** that simplifies how everyday investors **discover**, **research**, and 
**track** high-potential public companies — **faster** and more **enjoyably**.

We combine **30+ years of financial data**, intuitive **visualizations**, company **scoring**, and 
**interactive tools**, all in a single, **elegant platform**.

Our **mission** is to make investing **accessible**, **educational**, and **human-friendly**, especially for people 
without a finance background.

### What problem Smartfin tries to solve?

Millions of retail investors want to grow their wealth — but are blocked by 4 key barriers:

1. Company research is **time-consuming** and **overwhelming**.
2. Financial data is scattered, **complex**, and often **unintelligible**.
3. Most **lack professional experience** in evaluating investments.
4. **Financial jargon** and terminology make learning intimidating.

As a result, smart people:

- Avoid investing altogether 
- “Park” money in low-yield savings
- Rely on hearsay or Reddit hype — and get burned

Our take is: **Investing shouldn’t require a PhD or 200 hours of free time**.
